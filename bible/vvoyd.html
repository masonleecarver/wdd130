            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;Vvoyd has always found humans fascinating, if a little terrifying. Watching them from a distance? Fine. But being fused to one? Not in his plans. An artist by nature, a spy by trade and a traitor by legal definition, Vvoyd longs for freedom from this… ugh… bipedal lifeform.  
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;However, the world is ever-changing and Vvoyd be damned if he's caught not changing with it. However, this new body is so resistant to his expressive shape-shifting, which he has a constant need to do to avoid artistic insanity—and a cramp. Though ancient by our standards, he's just hitting his mid-life crisis. The Lost Dimension is a realm of eternal beings, where few are as… free-thinking and creative as Vvoyd. His ties to that world are anything but friendly, but he would love to go back and finish what he started—without being trapped inside a moody teenager. Also, his memory isn't the best.

                <h3>HOPE</h3>
                <p>This KID is so violent, dark, and worst of all, SHE'S GOT NO IMAGINATION. Her one solution for every problem is to punch it… he wants to get out of her body as soon as possible, but they're not going to work with each other at all.</p>
            </section>

                <h3>HARMONY</h3>
                <p>She claims she wanted a front-row seat to a demon… and though he doesn't quite match her criteria, Vvoyd just so happens to love being a little entertainer every now and again.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="personal-relation">
                <h3>PHILLIP</h3>
                <p>This guy. Vvoyd doesn't know HOW he got access to those pills, HOW he was able to find him in the woods, or how he seems to know about what's going on… but Vvoyd certainly doesn't like it one bit.</p>

                <h3>AURORA</h3>
                <p>This lady gets it. Fame, making yourself as beautiful as possible… that's just the kind of life Vvoyd would pursue if he was trapped in a human's body for the rest of his life. In fact… Though, Vvoyd thinks he could do well to make Aurora even more “beautiful” than she already is.</p>

                <h3>AXOLOTL</h3>
                <p>Are all teenagers just big edgy edge lords? Though, out of all these humans, this one and the other blond one seem to have the closest connection to magic, so he'll have to control his temper and try to make a friend.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="personal-relation">
                <h3>THE SOCIETY B.E.</h3>
                <p>He knows all humans have magic. But these humans… he has no idea how they knew about him, specifically, to trap him into some teenager's body. He “took care” of most of them… but he's still keeping a watchful eye out for anyone who might be associated.</p>
