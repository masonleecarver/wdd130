          After waking up in the forest with a new body-sharing roommate, a
          delinquent vigilante must outrun a cult with her family while
          maintaining justice.

          &emsp;Dark humor, family conflicts, mystery elements, secrets,
          internal struggles for control. This is what Quitter provides to
          televisions/streaming services everywhere. Everything is always trying
          to wrong her, but she's always ready to fight back. The world is a
          dark, mysterious place. The realm of this show may even go beyond this
          human realm... and into the twisted world where this shape-shifter
          came from.
          <br /><br />&emsp;It's essentially Batman if Batman was a vigilante
          teenage anti-hero who also has a demon-thing trapped inside of her.
          And she moves around a lot. <br /><br />&emsp; What inspired me to
          write this story is this whole situation where my aunt and mom thought
          I was possessed when I was around 13-14. I also really like Batman:
          The Animated Series and Gravity Falls, and this is kind of my
          ship-child of the two.
