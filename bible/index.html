          After waking up in the forest with a new body-sharing roommate, a
          delinquent vigilante must outrun a cult with her family while
          maintaining justice.

        <p>
          &emsp;After getting a demon trapped inside of her that has little to
          no interest in helping her on her pursuit of "justice," a
          violence-seeking vigilante high school girl goes on an adventure
          across the country to both run from a cult hunting her down and
          attempt to find a way to get this shape-shifter out of her.
          <br /><br />&emsp;Dark humor, family conflicts, mystery elements,
          secrets, internal struggles for control. This is what Quitter provides
          to televisions/streaming services everywhere. In the outside world,
          there's characters looking to harm the main character. Everything is
          always trying to wrong her, but she's always ready to fight back. The
          world is a dark, mysterious place, and the realm of this show may even
          go beyond this human realm... and into the twisted world where this
          shape-shifter came from. It's essentially Batman if Batman was a
          vigilante teenage anti-hero who also has a demon-thing trapped inside
          of her, and she moves around a lot. <br /><br />&emsp;What inspired me
          to write this story is this whole situation where my aunt and mom
          thought I was possessed when I was around 13-14. I also really like
          Batman: The Animated Series and Gravity Falls, and this is kind of my
          ship-child of the two. <br /><br />✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶ <br /><br />&emsp;Thank
          you, by the way, for even taking the slightest amount of interest in
          my story to keep reading this far. I've spent a long time working on
          this story so having anyone want to read it makes me happy. If you
          liked it or hated it, I'd love to know. <br /><br />&emsp;Despite what
          you may think, this story has nothing to do with Jujutsu Kaisen.
