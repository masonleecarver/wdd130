            We cracked the code. We deserve all the good things that we are going after, and we deserve nothing less than to rule the world. After all, who better to rule the world than those who understand the inner-workings of the realms beyond? These politicians who only know how to toy with humans in the most basic of ways have no right to be in our place.

            However, regrettably, we had a mishap. We lost some members. We will take back what is rightfully ours.

            Our plans will resume shortly. We will find you and your daughter, Silver. You cannot outrun us. It's merely an annoyance to watch you try.
