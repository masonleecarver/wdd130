                <h4>Escape Route</h4>
                <p>After Vvoyd, without pausing to get Hopeâ€™s permission, gets the help of a mad scientist in the local small town area in exchange to get experimented on--he goes through it and finds that it doesn't work. Maybe the scientist rigged it or it's because hope is still a pretty big part of him. Maybe it's because the only ones who can send him back are the ones that sent him to earth in the first place. He's going to do everything he can to think of something else to get him out of the body. He tries to get hope back home after all this failed science and finds that Aurora has locked them out of the house. Phillip has taken the other kids out for groceries, leaving just Aurora home to watch as Hope struggles to get inside of their home.</p>
                <p>She acknowledges them but refuses to let them in. Some other stuff goes down outside of the house (Robbers? Trick or treaters? A cop who thinks Hope is trying to break into the house? Bad weather? Wild animals? Sinkholes? Vvoyd trying to actually talk to Hope?? Cultists?? Maybe Vvoyd gets bored and wants to turn the town upside down and Hope has to stop him? Hope gets really hungry?) and Axolotl is the one to eventually let Hope back into the house. Of course, with the scientist posting his studies, the cult hunts them down and Phillip forces everyone to move again.</p>

                <h4>Mad Magic</h4>
                <p>
                    After a long trip of moving... again... Phil decides to take Hope and only Hope on a "business trip" with him. They go around scamming people for money, Phil using Hope's "sickness" as a ploy to gain affection, when they suddenly come across a magician living in his van. He's an even cornier conman than Phillip, and Vvoyd doesn't take kindly to being shown up, so Vvoyd shows up the magician by using Hope as a magic trick. Oh no, the magician doesn't like that one bit. He follows them back to their "house" that they're renting out and finds Aurora hanging around with Axolotl. He flirts with Aurora and she takes the bait, and then she helps the magician do something nefarious to Hope. Hope eventually punches out the magician, because her one solution to everything is to punch it, but the magician will now follow them for a few episodes to try to exact his revenge on hope, the better magician, until Phillip pins the cult onto him momentarily.

            <h4>Hope-less Romantic</h4>
            <p>
                You guys... there's actually someone in this world as dark and as twisted as Hope is. While Hope was out getting groceries and "accidentally" slipping into the sports section, she ran into the most gorgeous girl buying mouth guards and boxing gloves. They hit it off and became sparring partners for a date. Vvoyd wants to "help" Hope in her pursuit of this insane romance in his own insane, chaotic way. Aurora, of course, is completely against the idea. She says that Hope would never be able to love anyone with the way that she is--everyone in the family knows of her "condition" by this point--and that she would be better just hiding away. While Hope is originally totally against the idea, she learns that Vvoyd's chaos might actually be a good thing when his crazy idea to collect flowers from the bottom of a lake actually go over well in the overall romantic scheme of things. Meanwhile, Harmony is off collecting her own romances... with an arch-angel's kid with the ability to teleport who is dead-set on killing Vvoyd and Hope. But you don't understand, he's the only one who gets Christian mythology like Harmony does!! He doesn't make fun of her for liking angels so much, in fact, he loves them as much as she does. While the magician guy was more of a joke, this kid actually means business. He's a serious threat.

            <h1>Overall Arcs, Themes, Etc...</h1>
            <p>
                As for the structure of the show, I'm thinking of a lot of hints dropping regarding what the heck is going on. Vvoyd doesn't know exactly what happened, but someone certainly does. and they're not saying something about it. This is also a mystery show... lots of mysteries. The show moves in a linear fashion, where each episode follows each other, and there is a story arc over the course of the first season. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As for this story arc... they're being hunted down by a cult that believes they own Hope simply because they're the ones that put Vvoyd inside of her, and eventually they catch up and the frosts have to deal with them. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Vvoyd and Hope have to learn to live with each other. Hope and Harmony go through some personal struggles as well, having a falling out as Hope doesn't approve of ANY of Harmony's many boyfriends--especially not the one that turns out to be a demon-slaying angel that wants to hunt down and murder Hope/Vvoyd.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for Aurora, she will have a villainous arc, always trying to get Hope alone or trying to leave her behind when the family moves. We may have an episode dedicated to Hope and Aurora trying to work out their differences, but in the end, Aurora remains superficial.
            </p>
            <p>
                Phillip wants nothing more but to protect his daughter, even if it means lying and upheaving them from their home every few weeks without any explanation. He knows what's up, and his arc may include him finally coming to terms with his more than shady past... Phillip, you dirty, dirty, dawg.
            </p>
            <p>
                The themes of the show, like I said before, are family conflict, fighting your inner demons, justice... um. probably some other stuff. standing up for yourself and others who can't stand up for themselves. having a good heart even when your methods are crazy. not judging a book by its cover. all that good jazz.
            </p>
            <p>
                The story world includes many, many places in America. we got big cities, mountain towns, suburbs, swamps, deserts, forests, endless fields, probably some magic place. I think it would be hilarious if I made a joke about fnaf or this other tv show I tried to write that simply didn't make any sense. It was about this vampire who wanted to run a restaurant. He finally gets his time in the spotlight... my beautiful baby boy. they probably go to a town where everyone is a cultist and they want to sacrifice axolotl for some reason (probably because he's a "good-for-nothing") and Hope is like "aw hell naw" and it's way epic.
