          <p>
            As for the structure of the show, lots of foreshadowing. This is
            also a mystery show... It's a serialized show.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for this story arc... they're being hunted down by a cult who
            eventually catches them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Vvoyd and Hope have to learn to live with each other. Hope and
            Harmony go through some personal struggles as well, having a falling
            out.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for Aurora, she will have a villainous arc, always trying to get
            Hope alone or trying to leave her behind when the family moves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Phillip wants nothing more but to protect his daughter, even if it
            means lying and upheaving them from their home every few weeks
            without any explanation. He knows what's up, and his arc may include
            him finally coming to terms with his more than shady past...
            Phillip, you dirty, dirty, dawg.
          </p>
          <p>
            The story world includes many, many places in America. We got big
            cities, mountain towns, suburbs, swamps, deserts, forests, endless
            fields, probably some magic place.
