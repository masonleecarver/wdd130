        <div class="season2">
            <div class="arcs">
                <p>As for the structure of the show, I'm thinking of a lot of foreshadowing. This is also a mystery show... lots of mysteries. It's a serialized show.</p>
                <p>As for this story arc... they're being hunted down by a cult who eventually catches them.</p>
                <p>Vvoyd and Hope have to learn to live with each other. Hope and Harmony go through some personal struggles as well, having a falling out as Hope doesn't approve of ANY of Harmony's many boyfriends--especially not the one that turns out to be a demon-slaying angel that wants to hunt down and murder Hope/Vvoyd.</p>
                <p>As for Aurora, she will have a villainous arc, always trying to get Hope alone or trying to leave her behind when the family moves. We may have an episode dedicated to Hope and Aurora trying to work out their differences, but in the end, Aurora remains superficial.</p>
                <p>Phillip wants nothing more but to protect his daughter, even if it means lying and upheaving them from their home every few weeks without any explanation. He knows what's up, and his arc may include him finally coming to terms with his more than shady past... Phillip, you dirty, dirty, dawg.</p>
                <p>The themes of the show are family conflict, fighting your inner demons, justice, standing up for yourself and others who can't stand up for themselves, having a good heart even when your methods are crazy, not judging a book by its cover. all that good jazz.</p>
                <p>The story world includes many, many places in America. We got big cities, mountain towns, suburbs, swamps, deserts, forests, endless fields, probably some magic place.</p>
