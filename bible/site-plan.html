      <p>After getting a demon trapped inside of her that has little to no interest in helping her on her pursuit of "justice," a violence-seeking vigilante high school girl goes on an adventure across the country to both run from a cult hunting her down and attempt to find a way to get this shape-shifter out of her.<br>Dark humor, family conflicts, mystery elements, secrets, internal struggles for control. This is what Quitter provides to televisions/streaming services everywhere. In the outside world, there's characters looking to harm the main character. Everything is always trying to wrong her, but she's always ready to fight back. The world is a dark, mysterious place, and the realm of this show may even go beyond this human realm... and into the twisted world where this shape-shifter came from. It's essentially Batman if Batman was a vigilante teenage anti-hero who also has a demon-thing trapped inside of her, and she moves around a lot.<br>What inspired me to write this story is this whole situation where my aunt and mom thought I was possessed when I was around 13-14. I also really like Batman: The Animated Series and Gravity Falls, and this is kind of my ship-child of the two.

      <h3>Character Sheet Pages</h3>
      <p>Hope Frost - violence-loving "vigilante"<br>
        Hope sees the world as a breeding ground for darkness and evil… and she is no exception to this rule. Being the child of a super-hot mom and being interested in dark topics like death, murder, creepy-crawlies, and violence make her a target for bullying, but that doesn't bother her… much. What does bother her is the fact that these evil-doers can't seem to keep their hands off of other people…<br>
        How she deals with these crooks, monsters, and evil-doers is the only correct way-violence. She's knocked out teeth, broken bones, and spent several nights in juvenile detention for it. That doesn't stop her pursuit of “justice,” however.  
        Underneath all this bravado, however, she is just a kid… a kid seeking love and acceptance. Aww….. so cute….
        Despite not being the most creative, she can pick up on the little details and half-piece them together to come to a thrilling conclusion that can lead to more punches. Plus, her memory is basically unstoppable.<br>

      Relationships (beginning):<br> 
      Vvoyd <br>
      Thinks of him as another thing to punch. Is constantly in a battle of control with him, thinks his ideals of chaos and his “artistic endeavors” are dangerous with no practical use.<br>
      Harmony<br>
      Naturally, she thinks of Harmony as the good, smart older twin who makes her feel bad about herself.  Though, because they've spent so much time together, and because Harmony seems to be the only one her age not completely terrified of her, she has a soft spot for her “older” sister. <br>
      Phillip<br>
      Though she originally blamed Phillip for marrying such an ungodly monster, she's recently become more suspicious of him. However, he's giving her more attention and love than ever before-the one thing she's been craving-so her feelings towards him are a little complicated. <br>
      Aurora <br>
      She KNOWS her mom doesn't like her, and that's fine, because Hope doesn't like Aurora either. She wants proof that Aurora is as comically villainous as the other people she fights so she has a solid reason to knock her teeth in, but she keeps her anger to herself when she's around her dad. <br>
      Axolotl<br>
      She can appreciate his want for a normal life, and rather admires that he can live so freely. He exudes darkness, yet holds friends close to him, and he's shown her kindness in quiet moments… She's got a soft spot for him, too. <br>

      Vvoyd - being of indescribable, ever-changing form<br>
      Vvoyd has always found humans fascinating, if a little terrifying. Watching them from a distance? Fine. But being fused to one? Not in his plans. An artist by nature, a spy by trade and a traitor by legal definition, Vvoyd longs for freedom from this… ugh… bipedal lifeform. 
      However, the world is ever-changing and Vvoyd be damned if he's caught not changing with it. However, this new body is so resistant to his expressive shape-shifting, which he has a constant need to do to avoid artistic insanity—and a cramp. Though ancient by our standards, he's just hitting his mid-life crisis. The Lost Dimension is a realm of eternal beings, where few are as… free-thinking and creative as Vvoyd. His ties to that world are anything but friendly, but he would love to go back and finish what he started—without being trapped inside a moody teenager. Also, his memory is... not the greatest so he can't put Hope back together very "accurately."<br>

      Relationships (beginning): <br>
      Hope <br>
      This KID is so violent, dark, and worst of all, SHE'S GOT NO IMAGINATION. Her one solution for every problem is to punch it… he wants to get out of her body as soon as possible, but they're not going to work with each other at all. <br>
      Harmony<br>
      She claims she wanted a front-row seat to a demon… and though he doesn't quite match her criteria, Vvoyd just so happens to love being a little entertainer every now and again. <br>
      Phillip<br>
      This guy. Vvoyd doesn't know HOW he got access to those pills, HOW he was able to find him in the woods, or how he seems to know about what's going on… but Vvoyd certainly doesn't like it one bit. <br>
      Aurora <br>
      This lady gets it. Fame, making yourself as beautiful as possible… that's just the kind of life Vvoyd would pursue if he was trapped in a human's body for the rest of his life. In fact… 
      Though, Vvoyd thinks he could do well to make Aurora even more “beautiful” than she already is. <br>
      Axolotl<br>
      Are all teenagers just big edgy edge lords? Though, out of all these humans, this one and the other blond one seem to have the closest connection to magic, so he'll have to control his temper and try to make a friend.<br>
      The Society BE<br>
      He knows all humans have magic. But these humans… he has no idea how they knew about him, specifically, to trap him into some teenager's body. He “took care” of most of them… but he's still keeping a watchful eye out for anyone who might be associated.<br>
      Side characters<br>
      Harmony - The perfect twin<br>
      Life's full of angels, and angels are one of the more interesting parts of Christian Mythology. Harmony strives to live her life as an angel--happiness, beauty, kindness, power. Her true motives and emotions are hidden behind a near perfect façade of sunshine and rainbows.<br>
      Phillip - Protecting his family at ALL costs.<br>
      Phillip has always had a knack for keeping secrets hidden from people, and now he has to keep a pretty big secret from those he holds dear-his family. He's played his life like a game, cheating at every turn to come out on top, but that dangerous life has ended him in pretty hot water. He hides his terror behind well-placed smiles and continues pulling the strings behind a curtain of fatherly love.<br>
      Aurora - Does she have redeemable qualities??<br>
      The finer things in life are what make the effort of breathing worth-while. She uses her beauty to garner fame and riches for herself, filling a void in her heart left by the lack of parental love and attention in her childhood. Though she may seem superficial on the surface, somewhere, deep, deep, deep, deep inside of her diamond-edged heart she cares for other people. She just doesn't know how to show it.<br>
      Axolotl - Tired of this STUPID. DYSFUNCTIONAL. FAMILY.<br>
      Normalcy. Is that too much to ask? In this crazy, upside-down world, can't there be a semblance of anything resembling even an inkling of normal? Since there clearly cannot be such a thing in his own home, Axolotl tends to distance himself from his family, choosing to spend time with his friends and indulging, quietly, in his own hobbies such as D&D, reading, knitting, and programming.<br>

      The Society for the Betterment of the Enlightened (The Society BE) - The Spooky Boys. And Girls.<br>
      We cracked the code. We deserve all the good things that we are going after, and we deserve nothing less than to rule the world. After all, who better to rule the world than those who understand the inner-workings of the realms beyond? These politicians who only know how to toy with humans in the most basic of ways have no right to be in our place.
      However, regrettably, we had a mishap. We lost some members. We will take back what is rightfully ours.
      Our plans will resume shortly. We will find you and your daughter, Silver. You cannot outrun us. It's merely an annoyance to watch you try.<br>

      Affiliations: <br>
      Vvoyd <br>
      The monster with enough power to let us rule the world. More powerful than expected… we'll need more assistance.<br>
      Hope<br>
      The brat who was meant to be the Host. She wasn't supposed to be so active. We believe the sedative may have affected her memories.<br>
      Phillip<br>
      A simple man who's made many, many mistakes. <br>
      Aurora <br>
      A woman willing to make deals to get what she wants. We shall keep in contact, as she can serve to be a powerful ally.

      <h3>"Future Episodes"</h3>
      <p>
        <h4>a portal back home</h4>
        <p>After Vvoyd, without pausing to get Hope's permission, gets the help of a mad scientist in the local small town area in exchange to get experimented on--he goes through it and finds that it doesn't work. Maybe the scientist rigged it or it's because hope is still a pretty big part of him. Maybe it's because the only ones who can send him back are the ones that sent him to earth in the first place. He's going to do everything he can to think of something else to get him out of the body. He tries to get hope back home after all this failed science and finds that Aurora has locked them out of the house. Phillip has taken the other kids out for groceries, leaving just Aurora home to watch as Hope struggles to get inside of their home. She acknowledges them but refuses to let them in. Some other stuff goes down outside of the house (Robbers? Trick or treaters? A cop who thinks Hope is trying to break into the house? Bad weather? Wild animals? Sinkholes? Vvoyd trying to actually talk to Hope?? Cultists?? Maybe Vvoyd gets bored and wants to turn the town upside down and Hope has to stop him? Hope gets really hungry?) and Axolotl is the one to eventually let Hope back into the house. Of course, with the scientist posting his studies, the cult hunts them down and Phillip forces everyone to move again.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h4>phillip with hope</h4>
        <p>After a long trip of moving... again... Phil decides to take Hope and only Hope on a "business trip" with him. They go around scamming people for money, Phil using Hope's "sickness" as a ploy to gain affection, when they suddenly come across a magician living in his van. He's an even cornier conman than Phillip, and Vvoyd doesn't take kindly to being shown up, so Vvoyd shows up the magician by using Hope as a magic trick. Oh no, the magician doesn't like that one bit. He follows them back to their "house" that they're renting out and finds Aurora hanging around with Axolotl. He flirts with Aurora and she takes the bait, and then she helps the magician do something nefarious to Hope. Hope eventually punches out the magician, because her one solution to everything is to punch it, but the magician will now follow them for a few episodes to try to exact his revenge on hope, the better magician, until Phillip pins the cult onto him momentarily.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h4>hope-less romantic</h4>
        <p>you guys... there's actually someone in this world as dark and as twisted as hope is. while hope was out getting groceries and "accidentally" slipping into the sports section, she ran into the most gorgeous girl buying mouth guards and boxing gloves. they hit it off and became sparring partners for a date. vvoyd wants to "help" hope in her pursuit of this insane romance in his own insane, chaotic way. aurora, of course, is completely against the idea. she says that hope would never be able to love anyone with the way that she is--everyone in the family knows of her "condition" by this point--and that she would be better just hiding away. while hope is originally totally against the idea, she learns that Vvoyd's chaos might actually be a good thing when his crazy idea to collect flowers from the bottom of a lake actually go over well in the overall romantic scheme of things. meanwhile, harmony is off collecting her own romances... with an arch-angel's kid with the ability to teleport who is dead-set on killing vvoyd and hope. but you don't understand, he's the only one who gets christian mythology like harmony does!! he doesn't make fun of her for liking angels so much, in fact, he loves them as much as she does. while the magician guy was more of a joke, this kid actually means business. he's a serious threat.
