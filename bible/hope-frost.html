          &emsp;&emsp;Hope sees the world as a breeding ground for darkness and
          evil… and she is no exception to this rule. Being the child of a
          super-hot mom and being interested in dark topics like death, murder,
          creepy-crawlies, and violence make her a target for bullying, but that
          doesn't bother her… much. What does bother her is the fact that these
          evil-doers can't seem to keep their hands off of other people…
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;How she deals with these crooks, monsters, and evil-doers
          is the only correct way--violence. She's knocked out teeth, broken
          bones, and spent several nights in juvenile detention for it. That
          doesn't stop her pursuit of “justice,” however.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;Underneath all this bravado, however, she is just a kid… a
          kid seeking love and acceptance. Aww….. so cute….
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;Despite not being the most creative, she can pick up on
          the little details and half-piece them together to come to a thrilling
          conclusion that can lead to more punches. Plus, her memory is
          basically unstoppable.

          <h3>VVOYD</h3>
          <p>
            Thinks of him as another thing to punch. Is constantly in a battle
            of control with him, thinks his ideals of chaos and his “artistic
            endeavors” are dangerous with no practical use.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="personal-relation">
          <h3>HARMONY</h3>
          <p>
            Naturally, she thinks of Harmony as the good, smart older twin who
            makes her feel bad about herself. Though, because they've spent so
            much time together, and because Harmony seems to be the only one her
            age not completely terrified of her, she has a soft spot for her
            “older” sister.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="personal-relation">
          <h3>PHILLIP</h3>
          <p>
            Though she originally blamed Phillip for marrying such an ungodly
            monster, she's recently become more suspicious of him. However, he's
            giving her more attention and love than ever before-the one thing
            she's been craving-so her feelings towards him are a little
            complicated.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="personal-relation">
          <h3>AURORA</h3>
          <p>
            She KNOWS her mom doesn't like her, and that's fine, because Hope
            doesn't like Aurora either. She wants proof that Aurora is as
            comically villainous as the other people she fights so she has a
            solid reason to knock her teeth in, but she keeps her anger to
            herself when she's around her dad.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="personal-relation">
          <h3>AXOLOTL</h3>
          <p>
            She can appreciate his want for a normal life, and rather admires
            that he can live so freely. He exudes darkness, yet holds friends
            close to him, and he's shown her kindness in quiet moments… She's
            got a soft spot for him, too.
